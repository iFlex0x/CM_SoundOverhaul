## üìñ About The Mod

The **Complete Sound Overhaul** was a passion project aimed at transforming the auditory experience of *Combat Master*. The goal was to replace the default game audio with a more **powerful, immersive, and realistic soundscape**, making every firefight and interaction feel more visceral.

From the thunderous clap of a sniper rifle to the subtle click of a magazine being inserted, nearly every sound was meticulously replaced or remastered.

This mod was a comprehensive overhaul. The following categories were 100% completed:

  - [x] **Weapon Audio:** All firearms, including firing, reloading, and handling sounds.
  - [x] **Player Audio:** Footsteps, jumps, landing, vaulting, and damage feedback.
  - [x] **Explosive Audio:** Grenades, and environmental explosions.
  - [x] **UI & Announcer Audio:** Menu navigation, match events, and killstreak announcements.
  - [x] **Ambient Audio:** Background environmental sounds for all maps.
